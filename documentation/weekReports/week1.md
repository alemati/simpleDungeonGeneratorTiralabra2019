Coming into this course I had no idea what I am going to do. Luckily for me there was a compiled list of potential subjects, so first thing I did is I read about those listed topics. Dungeon generator from the first glance seemed like most fun. So I Googled it more carefully and found couple interesting articles and guides about it. So I decided to go with it.  

I only managed to create project, register myself in labtool and write specifications for program. I am yet to write any code.  

Next week I will try to get it going. At the beginnig I will be using Java's ready data structures and just focus on getting first results (map with rooms). After that will be flood fill algorithms turn.  

I didn't come across any problems. The only thing I wasn't sure about was project documentation language. I picked english, but I can change it at any moment if needed.
