This week I focused on filling all the open space between rooms with maze using flood fill algotithm.

### My thoughts  
At this point program uses only arrays, but it seems like I won't be able to finish project using only basic arrays 
and will be forced to change program structure quite a lot. There are a lot of recursive calls in code and I am afraid that 
it will negatively impact on performance.   

### Question  
Are basic, one and two dimensional arrays (arr[], arr[][]) allowed?

### Next week  
First, I will try to unite rooms with mazes without big structural changes. If I won't be able to do it due to current structure,
I will make changes and bring necessary data structures (ArrayList, HashMap).
