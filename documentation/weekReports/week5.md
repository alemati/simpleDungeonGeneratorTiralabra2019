sum | 8  |      

After receiving advice, I made iterative flood fill alghoritm and noticed that program doesn't crush anymore. It takes quite 
some time when creating big map, but it works. More info about performance will be added during next week. In order to make 
iterative version possible I also made myStack (not sure if my version is sensible, gotta check it more carefully next week).

### Question

### Next week   
I am planning to refactor my code in order to make it more understandable. Also documentation needs some polishing.
